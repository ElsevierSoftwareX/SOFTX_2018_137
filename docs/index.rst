pyBIMstab
=========

``pybimstab`` is an application software in **Python 3** to evaluate the factor
of safety against sliding of slopes made of Blocks-In-Matrix (BIM) materials. 

The assessment is donde by using the limit equilibrium method through the
General Limit Equilibrium (GLE) method of
`Fredlund & Krahn (1977) <https://doi.org/10.1139/t77-045>`_.

The slip surface has a tortuous geometry and is optimally found by using the
math:`\\mathrm{A}^\\ast` algorithm proposed by 
`Hart, Nilsson & Raphael (1968) <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300136>`_.
